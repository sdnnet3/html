									San Diego Zoo</a></h1>
									<p>5 reasons to visit the San Diego Zoo<br /></p>
								</header>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headline/IMG_0280.jpg" alt="Sky-shot" /></span>
								<b>1. </b>The first reason? Right off the bat, this place is huge. Not just a little huge, but a lot huge. This zoo comes in at about 100 acres, leaving you with plenty of ground to cover. So to make the most of this experience, you should come early and well rested (if you have kids, feel free to ignore this advice... we all know there's no such thing as rest). There is plenty of shade in the park mixed in with the park, so taking a route that lets you take a break from the sun is a great idea. If you really want to get the most out of the zoo, pick up a year pass and make a second trip. You will get to really take it easy and make it more about the experience instead of trying to get in all the animals you can in one day.</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/headline/IMG_0317.jpg" alt="Sky-shot" /></span>
							
								<b>2. </b>"The Institute for Conservation Research is one of the largest zoo-based research centers in the world." This institute has been around since 1975 and has exceled at developing and establishing methods that help them build self sustaining populations in the wild. When you visit this zoo, you are helping to preserve endangered species and helping pay for research with that goal.</p>

								<b>3. </b>I feel like this might be cheating as a reason, but I have kids. The statues littered about the park are fantastic, well maintained and have plenty of shade to keep little hands from burning. My personal favorite is the polar bear, but the elephants come in a close second just because the kids have a blas pretending to be squished by a large elephant.</p>

								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/headline/IMG_0374.jpg" alt="Sky-shot" /></span>
							
								<b>4. </b>Probably one of my favorite animals at the zoo, the Meerkat, is constantly on the lookout for skyward predators, and spend a great deal of their time looking towards the sky. You can usually see two or three of them on guard duty while the others relax in the sun. As cute as they are, I'm not sure you'd want them in your front yard as they are expert tunnelers.</p>

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/headline/IMG_0392.jpg" alt="Sky-shot" /></span>
							
								<b>5. </b>Africa Rocks! Though it's somewhat near the back of the park, in direct heat of the mid-day sun, it doesn't seem to bother these African animals that much. The relatively newer enclosures here are much more resemblent of their natural, open environment. Compared to what the enclosure looked like in the past, it's definitely a step up from what it once was. The entire part of this park is very well thought out and looks amazing. It's a must stop spot on your next trip.
